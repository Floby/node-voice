Beautiful stars through a windowpane, that's what I always see.
A candy shop with no glasses, that's where I want to be.
I can't stand it no more.
I need to get out of this situation.
I'm gonna tell you what I'm waiting for.
I need to get out of this relation.

You're no longer the one though I use to say.
I crossed my fingers when I told you that I need you every day.
and I can't remember why we fell in love.

A fairy tale with no happy ending, that's what I'm living now.
What would happen if I smashed the cell bars? I will know anyhow.
Baby you're not a star.
As long as you think so talk to the hand.
I'm driving my own car.
As far as I can and so until the very end.

You're no longer the one though I use to say.
I crossed my fingers when I told you that I need you every day.
and I can't remember why we fell in love..

A teddy bear with a lovely face, that's the kind of things I'm missing.
Having no home, being cold and tired, that's what I'm fed up with.
I can't stand it no more.
I need to get out of this situation.
I wish I had seen it before.
I really need to get right back home.

Honey, you're still the one, as I always say.
Did I ever tell you that I need you every day?
And I just remembered why we fell in love.
