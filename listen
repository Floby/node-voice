Let me tell you something, about the way you light my day.
You bring Paradise and Chocolate and Breezes of May.
And every time I see you down the street.
I can't help dreaming about the day we'd finally meet.
I'm the on who wants you. I'm the one who wants you so bad...

Let me tell you something else, about the way you make me feel.
I could be crazy, like in the movies, except, for real.
Ooh and when you get to stand so close to me.
I can tell that your skin has a taste of honey.
Don't walk out on me! stay a little longer around.

Hey! You make me feel all right.
Hey! You make me feel alive.
Hey! You're in my dreams at night.
Listen, lady! You make me feel alive.

Oh let me tell you another thing, about the way you make my life worthwhile.
My head is twiddling, twiddling like a turnstile.
Though you wouldn't know weather I dwell this earth.
You're the reason of my sorrow, anger and mirth.
I'm the one who wants you. Yeah! I'm the one who wants you so bad!

Hey! You make me feel all right.
Hey! You make me feel alive.
Hey! You're in my dreams at night.
Listen, lady! You make me feel alive.
